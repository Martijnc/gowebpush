# Go Web Push [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Martijnc/gowebpush.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Martijnc/gowebpush)
Go package for implementing Encrypted Content-Encoding for Web Push.

[Demo](https://playground.martijnc.be/web-push/)

# Deprecated
This repository implements an old draft of the specification and likely won't work with recent browser versions. Try [gauntface/web-push-go](https://github.com/gauntface/web-push-go) for an up-to-date Go Web Push implementation.

# Usage
A demo app that can be run on Google AppEngine, or locally using the [development server](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/tools/devserver), can be found in `appengine-demo`.
